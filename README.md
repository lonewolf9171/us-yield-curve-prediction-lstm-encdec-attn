# US Treasury Yield Prediction

Data: https://home.treasury.gov/ <br>
We use Deep Neural Networks to predict the yield curve for next 10 days based on the observations of last 30 days. Specifically we use an Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Encoder Decoder network architecture with Attention mechanism.
